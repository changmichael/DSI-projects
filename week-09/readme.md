Week 9 | Exercise 5.0

Write a Python program that lets you play tic tac toe against a computer.


```bash
('Hudson', 'Katty')

('Tim', 'Tucker')

('Peter', 'Michael')

('Phillippa', 'Tamara')

('Lydia', 'Rebecca')

('Sam', 'Kelly')


```
## Tips to get started
This is a relatively complex task, so think about how to break it down into component parts. Write functions for individual tasks. Call them multiple times.

Here are some things you may
- How will you define and update the board?
- How will a player make a move?
- How will the computer make a move?
- How will you check when the game is over?
- How will you check if a player has won, tied, or lost?
- What happens when the game is over? Does the program stop, or does it prompt you for another game?

## Challenge
1. Add formatting to your displays.
2. Make your AI smarter.
