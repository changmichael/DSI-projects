Week 7 | Exercise 1.0

Take the Roman numerals from 1-1000. [Here's a lookup table](http://literacy.kent.edu/Minigrants/Cinci/romanchart.htm) if you need a refresher.

1. Write a function to_roman() that converts an integer to its value as a Roman numeral.
2. Write a function from_roman() that does the reverse: convert a string of Roman numerals to its integer value.
3. Submit each of your functions to Slack. Look at your classmates functions. See if you can find a way to break their code.

Your functions should be able to handle integers from 1-1000 and return out the appropriate errors if the input is out of range, or of the wrong type.

Here's your partner for this morning:

```bash
('Peter', 'Tim')

('Katty', 'Tucker')

('Michael', 'Lydia')

('Phillippa', 'Rebecca')

('Tamara', 'Hudson')

('Kelly', 'Sam')
```
