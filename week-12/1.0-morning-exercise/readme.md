Week 11 | Exercise 5.0

### Background
If you're given a tricky whiteboarding question, you should start by coming up with the simplest answer that works first, then build up to a more efficient solution. For example, your first answer could be brute force, then as you go back to fix your code, you can discover shortcuts or ways to store fewer things in memory.

You may have heard the term **`greedy solution`** before. This refers to an implementation that stores a lot of possible answers in memory (i.e., has a high space complexity)


### Assignment
With a partner, **whiteboard** [this problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/mark-and-toys) from Hackerrank. Come up with a solution using whiteboard markers first. Once you decide on an implementation, take out your laptop and code it:

Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first kid. Their son is very fond of toys, so Mark wants to buy some. There are `N` different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices, but he has only `$K`. He wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money.

Now, you are Mark's best friend and have to help him buy as many toys as possible.

You input is two lines. On the first line are two numbers, `N` (the number of toys) and `K` (the amount of money he has). The second line is a list of `N` prices:

```
7 50
1 12 5 111 200 1000 10
```

Your sample output should be an integer: the number of toys Mark can buy. In this case, `4`.
