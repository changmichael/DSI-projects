## Introduction

We're going to practice our interview techniques in groups of three, with a focus on the skills covered in the whiteboarding lesson.

## Exercise

Let's pull up those interview questions again.

1. http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/66-job-interview-questions-for-data-scientists

2. https://leetcode.com/

Individually, select three problems: two algorithm or database problems from leetcode.com, and one of the more open-ended questions from datasciencecentral.com. (Go for difficult ones -- now is your time to practice.)

Get in your groups and find some whiteboard space! First talk through one sample open-ended question together, and agree what constitutes a solid answer. Then pool your nine questions and take turns in the following roles:

**ROLES**
- *The Interviewer* should ask the question, note the response, and ask follow-up questions accordingly. Put yourselves in the role of an interviewer: what items would they be most likely to follow up on?
- *The Interviewee* should answer the questions, demonstrate their logic, and prepare to answer follow-up questions.
- *The Notetaker* should take notes of the answers given by the Interviewee and look for gaps / issues to critique along with the Interviewer.

## Instructions
For the algorithm questions especially, focus on following the seven steps we covered in the previous lesson. Be sure to talk out your work.

The interviewer's job is to make sure everything is clear. Ask plenty of questions to drill down into the thought process. *If you see a bug, don't tell the interviewee!* They'll need to discover it themselves, but you may gently guide them towards it with probing questions. You should focus on how it feels to interview someone. Putting yourself in the shoes of your interviewer will help when you're on the other side of the table.


#### Requirements

- Individually assemble a list of three questions from the sources given (or from your experience in class). The more difficult the better!

- Form groups of three. Assign roles and rotating order. Share questions.

- Talk through one open-ended *sample* question as a group before beginning. Calibrate among yourselves what is "acceptable" in terms of answer completion and discussion.

- Alternate. Do one question for each person, and move on until all questions have been exhausted. Each question should take about 10-15 minutes. Provide feedback to each other as needed.

#### Deliverable

Answer questions and provide feedback to each other in groups of threes.
