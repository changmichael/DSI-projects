Week 7 | Exercise 1.0

### Pairs:
```bash
('Sam', 'Tucker')

('Hudson', 'Kelly')

('Tim', 'Lydia')

('Tamara', 'Michael')

('Peter', 'Phillippa')

('Rebecca', 'Katty')
```

### Background

Questions about sorting lists come up a lot in coding interviews. And there are plenty of algorithms out there that sort lists, with different amounts of time- and space- complexity.

Bubble sort is a relatively simple algorithm. As it passes over the list, it exchanges items that are out of order. It keeps passing over the list and exchanging items until the list is sorted:

### Challenge
Implement the bubble sort in Python.

Ask yourself - what is its time complexity? What is its space complexity?


### Further Reading
Insertion sort is another simple sorting algorithm. Look up how it works. Try to implement it in Python.

Bubblesort and insertion sort are known as 'weak' sorting algorithms. Which algorithms tend to perform better? How do they work? What are their complexities?

Here's an [animation of several sorting algorithms](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms).
Here's [another animation page](http://sorting.at/).
