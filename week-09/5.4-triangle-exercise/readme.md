This afternoon we are going to have a team-based competition. The goal is to create the best performing model on a hold-out sample of data. Simple right? 

Well, there is a catch. 

This will be a constrained optimization. To understand what that means, let's take a look at the Project Management Triangle.

# ![](http://www.joesdump.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/GoodFastCheap_Pick2.png)

The idea is that for any project you can have any two of these. You can have good work done cheap, but it will take a long time. You can have good work done fast, but it won't be cheap. Or you can have work done fast and on the cheap, but it won't be good. 

Today we will apply this concept to data science. 

You will be given a dataset and asked to pick two of the following: samples, features, algorithm. Here's how it will work. You will be given the training set and 30 minutes to decide which of the following you would like to choose for our competition:

### Bundle #1 
- Your choice of algorithm
- Your choice of features
- **My choice of samples**

### Bundle #2
- Your choice of algorithm
- **My choice of features**
- Your choice of samples

### Bundle #3
- **My choice of algorithm**
- Your choice of features
- Your choice of samples

You should be aware that **"my choice" options** while not the worst-case scenario, **will be highly unfavorable to you.**  Choose wisely.

Once you have made your selection, your team will have 1.5 hours to build the best model possible under those constraints.

There will be an award for the winning team. It will be favorable to you.

The feature data can be downloaded [here](./assets/data/X_train.csv) and the target can be downloaded [here](./assets/data/y_train.csv)

The goal is to predict if a person's income is in excess of $50,000 given certain profile information.
