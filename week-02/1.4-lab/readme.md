## Introduction
We have been introduced to numpy and pandas. Let's compare how to do some simple stats with both.

We've included a dataset of crime records in San Francisco and some instructions for how to practice
#### Requirements

- Use the dataframe provided in the starter code or create your own
- Using [the SF crime csv](./assets/datasets/sf_crime.csv), do the following:
1. Load in the dataset using Pandas
2. Print the head
3. Find the unique categories of crimes
4. Print the unique districts
5. Create a DataFrame of unique categories and count of crimes by category
6. Create a DataFrame of unique districts and crime counts per districts
7. Create a DataFrame showing crime counts by day of the week. (bonus: plot this)
8. Describe one of the data sets

- Using the two lists of numbers in the starte rcode, ('control' and 'experiment') calculate the mean difference and t-statistic. Then, find the mean, minimum value, maximum value, and median value of using
numpy and pandas. 

**Check** Is numpy or pandas easier to use? Why? Are there some things that you can do in numpy
but not in pandas or vice versa?


#### Starter code
