Week 7 | Exercise 5.0

Let's prove DSI students are smarter than web development students.

You have 45 minutes to teach yourself how to build a webpage. Go.
- Create two files, `index.html` and `style.css`
- Add text to your HTML page.
- Style it with CSS
- Load JQuery
- Add in some [JQuery](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/) effects. Make it interactive.
  - What's JQuery? Why do I use it? How do I use it? Figure it out! Google it!


If you realllllly need some help, here's some simple starter code. Copy these line-by-line. Don't copy-paste.

Here's some basic HTML:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My page title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Here is my header</h1>

    <p>Here is some normal body text</p>.

    <p>Let me hit you with a <a href='https://d3js.org/'> link </a></p>
  </body>
</html>

```

And here is some very simple css:
```css
body {
  background-color: #d8da3d
}

a:link {
    color: blue
  }
a:visited {
    color: purple
  }
```

If you're still totally lost, the `code` folder has a sample page you can check out.
