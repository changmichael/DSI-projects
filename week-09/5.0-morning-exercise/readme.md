Week 9 | Exercise 5.0

Turn on a new Amazon EC2 instance running **Ubuntu**.

```bash
('Kelly', 'Tamara')

('Tucker', 'Hudson')

('Phillippa', 'Peter')

('Michael', 'Katty')

('Tim', 'Sam')

('Lydia', 'Rebecca')

```

## Challenges
1. Enable your .ssh and config files to give it a host name. You should be able to launch the EC2 from local by running `ssh my-cool-host-name`
2. Explain to your partner what's going on here.
3. . Copy a csv to the cloud in a folder called `my_cool_csv`. Use the titanic dataset, or anything else you like.
4. . Install [postgres](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL) on your cloud machine.


## Super Challenge: `cron`
Use `cron` on your cloud machine so that a file in your home directory is updated every minute.

Confirm that it is updating every minute.

Turn off the `cron` job.

This is hard. [Here](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=what+is+cron)'s a way to get started.
