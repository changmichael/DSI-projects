## Introduction

- In this lab we will practice using the pivoting skills that we acquired in the last lesson.

#### Requirements

- Use this [rock song data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/W2-L3.2/curriculum/04-lessons/week-02/3.2-lab/assets/datasets/rock.csv?token=AGCAl0AuJEZUxW7ynChoJ1L-6_4Gh5qnks5W-oL1wA%3D%3D)

and complete the following requirements:

    - Import pandas and numpy
    - Read in rock.csv as a data frame
    - The simplest pivot table must have a dataframe and an index . Letâ€™s use the ARTIST CLEAN as our index.
    - How about indexing on multiple values. Let's look at the data by ARTIST CLEAN and Release Year next.
    - Explicitly define the 'PlayCount' column by using the values field.

#### Starter code
- The [rock starter code](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/blob/W2-L3.2/curriculum/04-lessons/week-02/3.2-lab/code/starter-code/W2%20L3.2%20rock%20starter%20code.ipynb)
- The [real estate starter code](https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/blob/W2-L3.2/curriculum/04-lessons/week-02/3.2-lab/code/starter-code/W2%20L3.2%20realEstate%20starter%20code.ipynb)

**Bonus:**
- Perform all of the requirements that you did on the rock set data, on this [real
estate data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/generalassembly-studio/dsi-course-materials/W2-L3.2/curriculum/04-lessons/week-02/3.2-lab/assets/datasets/Sacramentorealestatetransactions.csv?token=AGCAl5vHDB5HS1EjbKmb6cTkodmi7Cy8ks5W-oLQwA%3D%3D).
