Week 8 | Exercise 2.0

Let's do some more with Python and .py files. You shouldn't even need to open jupyter notebook for this exercise. Here's your partner:

```bash
('Kelly', 'Katty')

('Tim', 'Sam')

('Tamara', 'Michael')

('Hudson', 'Tucker')

('Lydia', 'Rebecca')

('Phillippa', 'Peter')
```

### Pair Program #1: Files calling files

Create a file `temperature.py`. Write two functions in that file: `def celsius_to_farenheit(x):` and `def farenheit_to_celcius(x)` that convert between units. Save and close the file.

Run `python` from the command line. You can now import that file (like you do for every other Python package!). Run your programs by calling them from `temperature`:

```Python
>>> import temperature
>>> print temperature.farenheit_to_celcius(95)
35
```

### Pair Program #2: `curl`ing

`curl` is another command line prompt. It takes data from a URL and feeds it into the interpreter. Try typing this:

```bash
$curl http://textfiles.com/stories/elveshoe.txt
```

Go back to your `counter.py` file from yesterday to generate word counts on this file by calling:

```bash
$curl http://textfiles.com/stories/elveshoe.txt | ./counter.py > output.txt
```

**Now, rewrite your workflow so you clean the text (encode, remove punctuation, convert to lowercase) in a function defined in a new file.**

For example, create a file `my_cleaner.py` that contains the function `def clean_text(x)`

When you're done, your `counter.py` file should look something like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
import my_cleaner

for line in sys.stdin:
  line = my_cleaner.clean_text(line)
  #do something
```

### Challenge
Pick one of the longer stories from [textfiles.com/stories/](http://textfiles.com/stories/). Create a plot of the most commonly used words. Don't open a Jupyter notebook for this.
