Week 6 | Exercise 5.0

Good morning! There's a short exercise in the attached Jupyter notebook to get you thinking about how to work with text data. Work through those cells with a partner. Then, go back to prepping your capstone presentation. 

Here's your partner for this morning:

```bash
('Phillippa', 'Lydia')

('Hudson', 'Peter')

('Tucker', 'Rebecca')

('Tim', 'Tamara')

('Sam', 'Kelly')

('Katty', 'Michael')
```
