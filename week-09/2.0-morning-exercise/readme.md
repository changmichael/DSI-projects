Week 9 | Exercise 2.0

Using the [speed dating dataset](data/speed_dating_user_attributes.csv) from last week, decide with your partner on a variable you want to predict. Then, build a model to predict it. Finally, create a way to communicate your results by building a Flask application.


```bash
('Tamara', 'Tim')

('Michael', 'Phillippa')

('Tucker', 'Hudson')

('Sam', 'Kelly')

('Katty', 'Lydia')

('Peter', 'Rebecca')


```
## Tips to get started
This is a relatively complex task, so think about how to break it down into component parts. Write functions for individual tasks. Call them multiple times.

Here are some things you may
- How will you define and update the board?
- How will a player make a move?
- How will the computer make a move?
- How will you check when the game is over?
- How will you check if a player has won, tied, or lost?
- What happens when the game is over? Does the program stop, or does it prompt you for another game?

## Challenge
1. Optimize the model. Gridsearch its parameters. Compare it to other models.
2. Customize the input and output of the app.
2. Export a matplotlib plot to the page. [Here](https://gist.github.com/wilsaj/862153)'s an example.
